## 🎯 **Learning Outcomes**  

### **1️⃣ Large Language Models (LLMs) & Transformers**  
- Text preprocessing and converting text to vector so that model can understand that. 
- Understanding **Transformer architecture** & **self-attention mechanism**  
- Training & fine-tuning models like **GPT-3, Llama, Falcon, Mistral**  
- Implementing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with vector databases  

### **2️⃣ AI-powered Applications**  
- **Prompt Engineering** techniques for better AI responses  
- Using **Whisper for audio transcription** & **DALL-E for image generation**  
- Source code analysis & **financial stock analysis with AI**  

### **3️⃣ LangChain & AI Automation**  
- Basics of **LangChain & LangChain Agents**  
- Integrating **Hugging Face models** with LangChain  
- Implementing **LlamaIndex** for structured data retrieval  

### **4️⃣ Data Analysis & Curation**  
- Working with **SQL, Excel, Tableau, PowerBI**  
- Web scraping with **BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Scrapy**  
- Preparing datasets for AI model training & evaluation
